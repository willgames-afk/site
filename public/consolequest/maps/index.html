        <!--Content Goes Here-->
        <p>Here you can find all the console quest maps that have been made. Poke will a lot, and maybe he'll make more, or just text him and he'll teach you how to do it! Note: The newest games are closest to the top of the list.</p>
        <p>
          To actually play one of these maps, download it by clicking on it. Then, you have to go to the <a href="/consolequest/">
        Game Page (click me)</a>. There should be a button that says Choose File, click it and select the map file that you downloaded. Then open the terminal (right click, select inspect) and type start. Then, type loadmap and the map SHOULD load. If it doesn't, give me a yodel and I'll fix it.
