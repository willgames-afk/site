	<p>HeavyStack is a programming language I created for fun- It's like Brainf*ck but more annoying and more complecated.</p>
	<p>This is an interpereter for HeavyStack- type in code in the top, and it spits out the result in the bottom when you hit
		Run. It autosaves your code locally as you type, so it won't be deleted on an accidental page reload. It's also 
		programmed to give the browser time to do its thing- If you code in an infinite loop it won't crash the page. Finally, 
		there's an export button to save the program as a file (for more permanent storage)</p>

	<p>
		The language consists entirely of symbols, which all operate on The Stack and The Accumulator.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Accumulator (Henceforth abbreviated to ACC) usually contains a single number.
		You can increment it by 1 using `.`, and decrement it using `,`. Also, keep in mind that it is set to a random number 
		on program start- It does not start out as 0.
	</p>
	<p>
		But one number is not enough- we need more! So, you can use `&lt;` to push the ACC onto a FIFO data structure refered to 
		The Stack. FIFO, for those who aren't aware, means First In First Out. You can pop data off the stack using `&gt;`. Finally,
		you can use `$` to swap the top 2 elements on the stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just incrementing and decrementing isn't cool enough, so I've included 5 math operators- + for addition, - for Subtraction,
		* for Multiplication, / for division, and % for modulo (Division but keep the remaindier instead of long dividing). <br>
		All of them work in the same way:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pop both operands off the stack</li>
		<li>Perform their operation</li>
		<li>Store the result in ACC</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Watch out for the order in which it removes operands- It will first pop the leftmost operand, then the rightmost-<br>
		If I had the stack `10, 5` with 5 being the top element, and tried to do a subtraction, I'd get -5. <br>
		Numbers can be positive or negative, and aren't confined to the integers- You can get numbers with decimal places. <br>
		Division by 0 puts a special number type called NaN in the ACC- more about that later.
	</p>
	<p>
		What if you want to print something? Well, you can output the current value of the ACC as a UTF-16 code unit using `^`. 
		Eventually you'll also be able to recieve a character of input using `?`, but I haven't done that yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is great and all, but there are no loops. Luckily, you've got Curly Braces It will jump backwards from a `}` to a
		matching `{`- In this example: `{  {} }`, the final `}` would jump all the way back to the first `{`. <br><br>

		There's also Square Brackets- It will skip the code inside a pair of these if the ACC is exactly 0.
	</p>
	<p>With that, we have a fairly capable system, but there's 1 fatal flaw- We can only work with 3 things at a time.
	I can mess with the top and 2nd thing down in the stack, and have something in the ACC- That's 3 things. If I want to get
	access to anything below that, I have to get rid of one of those 3 values. Luckily, there's one final feature: Blobs!<br><br>

	The `:` function will take everything off the top of the stack until it hits a NaN. It'll put all of those numbers (and the NaN) 
	into a new FIFO Queue, AKA Stack, AKA Blob and then put that blob into the ACC.
	</p>
  	<p>
	All the stack operations work as normal on blobs, but they're treated like 1 element.
	All the math operations treat blobs like 0- So does `^`, `.`.
	`[` treats blobs like 0s unless they have only 2 elements- this is useful for detecting the end of a blob.
	`,` will remove the top element from the blob and place it onto the top of the stack. This is the element that was deepest in 
	the stack when the blob was blobified.
	Finally, `:` will extend a blob in the ACC if there's already one there.
