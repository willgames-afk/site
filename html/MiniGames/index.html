        <p>Here is THE PLACE to find my versions of snake, space invaders, flappy bird, and other classic games. They're nothing special, I just felt like messing around a bit, and I may use these later for AI training or in other games as minigames anyway.</p>
        <h2>Snake</h2>
        <p>Get as many food pellets as you can while avoiding your own tail. You can also disable wraparound by pressing G which means you can crash into walls too.</p>
