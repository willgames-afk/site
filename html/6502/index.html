            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Here, you can find links to the tools I use to develop for my own 6502 computer, the w-0, as well as some
                programs I've made.</p>
            <p>For those who don't know, the 6502 is a 40-year-old computer chip that kickstarted the home computer industry. Many
                retro computers and consoles run off the 6502 or a 6502 variant, including the NES, Atari 8-bit family,
                Commodore 64, BBC Micro, and Apple II, as well as many others. A modern version is still manufactured
                today, and enthusiasts like <a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=ayh0qebfD2g'>The 8-Bit Guy</a> are
                STILL making computers based around it and writing code for those old systems.</p>
